Several years ago, I bought a couple of [these temperature and humidity sensors](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-Wireless-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Android/dp/B01AEQ9X9I) for my van. I used them to monitor the indoor and outdoor conditions and they were super helpful in letting me know whether I needed to plan to heat/cool the van before going to bed.

Yesterday, I realized that the battery in one of the sensors had died, so I looked up where I could buy a replacement. The sensor needed a CR2477 battery, which - of course - you could only buy online. Well, it turned out that I could buy a [whole new sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R586J37) cheaper than a CR2477 and Amazon could deliver that new sensor to a nearby Amazon Hub Locker within 24 hours. I picked an Amazon Locker in the general direction of where I was headed and planned to be there sometime within the next 4 days.

As usual, Amazon is awesome and they delivered the new sensor to the Amazon Hub Locker in less than 24 hours. Now I can monitor the van temps again. ðŸ˜Š
