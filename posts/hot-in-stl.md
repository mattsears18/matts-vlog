Yesterday, St. Louis had a high of 97‚Ñâ and I got to climb into bed at 10PM and practice sleeping hot yoga with an internal van temp of 88‚Ñâ. üòµ‚Äçüí´ Things got better when my propane gas detector started blaring at 3AM. Not wanting to have the cops called after the alarm woke the entire neighborhood, I jumped out of bed and turned it off. [Here's what happened next](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxCNmVZp2Pw). Jk...

Now, in the two years that I lived in this van, I never once had a propane leak, and I was certain that all of the shutoff valves were closed on the propane lines. I also knew that the propane sensing module in the propane detector had a shelf life that had long since passed. Conclusion: the propane gas detector was probably just malfunctioning... probably. But I couldn't just go back to sleep without confirming that I WASN'T sleeping in a space full of propane gas.

Fortunately, there's a very simple test for detecting propane gas. I put some pants on and climbed into the driver's seat... just in case. I grabbed a lighter out of my cigar humidor, pointed the lighter toward the back of the van, and... BOOM! HA, kidding. The flame confirmed that there was no propane gas present.

I crawled back into bed and went to sleep.
